                <p>What I dreamed to be when I grow up as an adult is to be successful
                as a robotics engineer and my only way to achieve this is to work 
                hard and do well in school moving into college. The reason I take
                this path is to see if my ambitions are true to its word and lead 
                me to the life I hope to achieve.</p>
                <p>Last year of 2017-2018, I took a couse on design engineering and right now 
                I’m taking a course on Computer Science to be able to learn what it 
                takes to be an coder. Being able to define the problems, 
                brainstorming ideas, building on those ideas and creating the 
                final solution are some of the skills I’ve accumulated. I have 
                also experienced and learned a great deal while being in the high 
                school marching band which was to know how to work with in a huge 
                group of people.</p>
                <p>What I’m most accomplished about during high school so far is 
                earning the Sweepstakes award in a marching competition. If I 
                continue this road of success, I will surely reach my goal 
                through the experiences I learn and conquer. Thank you for your time
                reading this and feel free to check out the rest of my site. My 
                email is runtiganjones@gmail.com.</p>
