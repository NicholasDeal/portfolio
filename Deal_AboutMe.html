                <p>What I dreamed to be when I grow up as an adult is to be successful
                as a robotics engineer. Right now, my career goal is redirected 
                into being a programmer and my only way to achieve this is to 
                work hard and do well in school moving into college. I will also 
                participate in internships when I get the chance to take them. 
                The reason I take this path is to see if my ambitions are true to 
                its word and lead me to the life I hope to achieve which is to be 
                able to have a stable income.</p>
                <p>Last year of 2017-2018, I took a couse on design engineering
                called Intro to Engineering Science and right now I’m taking a 
                course on Computer Science Principles to be able to learn what it 
                takes to be a pragrammer. When I'm working on a project, I'm 
                always organized and patient with my work which is really 
                important for a programmer because there's a lot of trial and 
                error when you're coding. Being able to define the problems, 
                brainstorming ideas, building on those ideas and creating the 
                final solution are some of the skills I’ve accumulated. </p>
                <p>During high school, what I’m most accomplished about so far is 
                earning the Sweepstakes award in a marching competition. The 
                thing that makes this Sweepstakes the most special one is that 
                it's the first ever one that the Dublin High Marching Band has
                ever got. I have also experienced and learned a great deal while 
                being in the high school marching band which was to know how to 
                work with in a huge group of people. The key thing about being
                in a marching band is that it's all about our formation. During 
                field shows, each and every one of us has to keep note who is 
                next to who and this requires a lot of concentration and effort.</p>
                <p>My overall goal is to be a programmer because I believe it 
                will help me reach financial stability and I also find it quite 
                enjoyable. I have learned a lot from being in the marching band 
                and being in different engineering classes on what it takes to 
                be a proficient worker. If I continue this road of success, 
                I will without a doubt reach my ultimate goal through the 
                experiences I learned and conquer. Thank you for your time 
                reading this and feel free to check out the rest of my site.
