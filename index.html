        <h1>Nicholas Deal's Engineering Portfolio</h1>
            <p>What I dreamed to be when I grow up as an adult is to be 
            successful as a robotics engineer and my only way to achieve 
            this is to work hard and do well in school moving into 
            college. The reason I take this path is to see if my ambitions 
            are true to its word and lead me to the life I hope to achieve.</p>

                    <p>When I became a freshman in high school, I joined the 
                    high school marching band. I had many struggles of
                    working together with my bandmates during field shows. 
                    We did various field show performances and 
                    concert shows during the school year.</p>

                    <p>This is a project that was done during my time in the CSP
                    course in junior year of high school. We had to learn the
                    basics of how to use the code in Scratch. Then we had
                    to create either a game or a story using the Scratch skills
                    we learned.</p>

                        <p>During my sophomore year of high school, I 
                        enrolled in an engineering course for design engineering.
                        We used a 3D modeling program called Autodesk Inventor
                        to learn the concepts and integrities of designing.</p>

                    <p>This is the second project we took in the CSP course.
                    Similar to the Scratch project, we had to learn a new code
                    that's exclusive to App Inventor for Android. Our goal was
                    to create a game using the App Inventor code.</p>
