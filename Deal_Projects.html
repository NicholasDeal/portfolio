            <h4>Scratch Project</h4>
            <h6 class="text-muted">September 2018 - Computer Science Principles</h6>
            <p>This is a project that was done during my time in the CSP course in 
            junior year of high school. We had to learn the basics of how to use the 
            code in Scratch. Then we had to create either a game or a story using the 
            Scratch skills we learned. We also learned that coding requires great 
            patience and lots of trial and error. I worked with another partner, so 
            we had separate roles. My main role was to keep track of the 
            documentation of the project. I also helped with some of the coding for 
            the game we wanted to make. The most laborious challenge was making the 
            individual levels and trying to be creative with them. It required us to 
            go over the problems we had and try to help each other out. Overall we 
            were succussful as a team.</p>

            <h4>App Inventor Project</h4>
            <h6 class="text-muted">October 2018 - Computer Science Principles</h6>
            <p>This is the second project we took in the CSP course. Similar to the 
            Scratch project, we had to learn a new code that's exclusive to App 
            Inventor for Android. Our goal was to create a game using the App 
            Inventor code.</p>
