            <h4>Scratch Project</h4>
            <h6 class="text-muted">September 2018 - Computer Science Principles</h6>
            <p>This is a project that was done during my time in the CSP course in 
            junior year of high school. We had to learn the basics of how to use the 
            code in Scratch. Then we had to create either a game or a story using the 
            Scratch skills we learned. We also learned that coding requires great 
            patience and lots of trial and error. I worked with another partner, so 
            we had separate roles. My main role was to keep track of the 
            documentation of the project. I also helped with some of the coding for 
            the game we wanted to make. The most laborious challenge was making the 
            individual levels and trying to be creative with them. It required us to 
            go over the problems we had and try to help each other out. Overall we 
            were succussful as a team.</p>

            <h4>App Inventor Project</h4>
            <h6 class="text-muted">October 2018 - Computer Science Principles</h6>
            <p>This is the second project we took in the CSP course. Similar to the 
            Scratch project, we had to learn a new code that's exclusive to App 
            Inventor for Android. Our goal was to create a game using the App 
            Inventor code. I worked with a partner on this game so we had 
            different roles. Our game is based on a bird that's trying to escape 
            dungeon and you score points by reaching the edges of the screen. I 
            was mostly in-charge with the coding aspect for the game and my 
            partner worked mostly on the documentation that includes our recorded 
            progress. It took about three weeks to make but we had to solve a 
            few persistent issues. There was a problem where the score board
            didn't show itself completely. The controls for the bird required
            a lot of time to tweak. At the end of the project development, our
            game turned out to be very satisfactory because we improved upon our
            skills to communicate with each other.</p>
